## Information

The usefulness of this plugin is that the heads of the mobs (vanilla) are given 
when its entity dies with a drop rate of 100%. 

The infuenced entities are *zombies*, *skeletons* and *creepers*.

You don't need to configure anything! 

To use the plugin, you must be (for the moment) in **1.19.1**
